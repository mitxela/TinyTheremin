# ATtiny85 Theremin with only one component
This is an odd one, and attempt to build a theremin by abusing the onboard ADC. The results are not entirely discouraging! See [this page](https://mitxela.com/projects/a_tiny_theremin) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4qf5L1Ww-A) for more info.
